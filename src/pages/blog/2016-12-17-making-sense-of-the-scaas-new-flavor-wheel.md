## Background

I am a full time senior lecturer, father of 3, but I am also a part time PhD student. 

## The issue

Finding time to work ont he PhD is hard. Spending time with the family always seems like the right thing to do when out of work and when in work the job simply must get done. so where does the time come from. 

## The solution

> The time was actually always there. It is just  a matter of being a little bit more organised and just doing a bit at a time. 

I used to see undertaking research and PhD work as requiring big chunks of my time without any interruptions. And here was my issue. I very rarely have big chucks of time to allocate to one thing. My life simply does not allow that. So I used to plan big pieces of work to a deadline and as the deadline looms, simply burn the candle at both ends until the deadline was met. I have met most of my deadlines to be honest.

So if I can make and meet these deadlines why do I always feel so guilt and like I am not making progress on the PhD? After much reading about this and also much soul searching I have decided that it is because I do the work in these sporadic spits and bursts. 

My only solution to stop feeling like this is to be doing a bit at a time. This is when it hit me. I do not need big chunks of time but better project planning and short amounts of time each day (15 minutes to an hour). By doing a little each day I feel like I am making progress. I still set myself the deadlines but find I do not:

1. need to burn the candle at both ends (as much).
2. feel disconnected form the PhD like I did.
3. rely on the deadlines to actually make some ground on the work.

## Give it a try. 

Give yourself a shortish deadline for a chunk of work, say a month from now to write a section of your lit review. Then spend an hour breaking this down into smaller work tasks you can achieve between an 15min and an hour.

Then each day just make sure you do your 15/minutes to an hour. 

I find that I am not creating a new 15 minutes to an hour but instead am just using the time when I used to procrastinate after telling myself you do not have enough time to some PhD work.  The time was always there, it was just not wrapped up a pretty little chunk of time with a bow on it.
