heading: Analysis of Transaction Logs from National Museums Liverpool
description: >-
  The websites of Cultural Heritage institutions attract the full range of users, from professionals to novices, for a variety of tasks. However, many institutions are reporting high bounce rates and therefore seeking ways to better engage users. The analysis of transaction logs can provide insights into usersâ€™ searching and navigational behaviours and support engagement strategies. In this paper we present the results from a transaction log analysis of web server logs representing user-system interactions from the seven websites of National Museums Liverpool (NML). In addition, we undertake an exploratory cluster analysis of users to identify potential user groups that emerge from the data. We compare this with previous studies of NML website users.
